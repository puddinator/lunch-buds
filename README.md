# lunch-buds

This is my team's submission for DSTA's CODE_EXP hackathon. I was the primary coder while my 2 teammates did the UX/UI and presentation. The app is a lunch-buddy-finding mobile app that uses innovative gamification concepts to help work colleagues foster genuine friendships. 

The frontend is built with React Native Expo. The backend is built with the MERN stack and also makes use of the OpenAI api to generate conversation questions.
